## Offline Models
 
This folder is intentionally empty.

Download the model files from Google Drive (see main README) and place them here.

Note: You need to place a distilBERT_sentiment or compatible model here only if you want to train your own models

Options:

A. run install_models.py for automatic download of distilbert_sentiment/politone and placing them so PoliPulse can use them or

B. download distilbert_sentiment from 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YRs3IImXqkn3_iJg5HhrJbkhivy3L4fV/view?usp=drive_link

and place it into this folder and do the same with distilbert_politone_finetuned
