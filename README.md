# PoliPulse CA

**PoliPulse CA** is a Streamlit-based application for analysing transcribed political speeches using transformer models. It supports three main features:
- üìà **General Trend Analysis** of sentiment or political tone
- üìä **Group Comparison Analysis** between two sets of speeches
- üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Transformer Fine-Tuning** for political tone classification

## Features

- Upload `.txt`, `.docx`, or `.zip` speech files
- Select and configure transformer models for sentiment or tone analysis
- Apply statistical tests and visualise trends
- Fine-tune DistilBERT models with configurable training options

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/patrijo/PoliPulseCA.git
    cd PoliPulseCA
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
	```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

3. Install the transformer models by running script:
	```bash
	python install_models.py		
	```

- *Note: You can also install manually by downloading the two models and extracting them to their folders:
	place into sentiment_model: 
	distilbert_sentiment: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YRs3IImXqkn3_iJg5HhrJbkhivy3L4fV/view?usp=drive_link
	place into politone_model:
	distilbert_politone: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18mlm08N71XfyrRhVOPyXGCoeAqyaLnZC/view?usp=drive_link*</small>

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
