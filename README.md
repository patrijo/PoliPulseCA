# PoliPulse CA

**PoliPulse CA** is a Streamlit-based application for analysing transcribed political speeches using transformer models. It supports three main features:
- üìà **General Trend Analysis** of sentiment or political tone
- üìä **Group Comparison Analysis** between two sets of speeches
- üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Transformer Fine-Tuning** for political tone classification

## Features

- Upload `.txt`, `.docx`, or `.zip` speech files
- Select and configure transformer models for sentiment or tone analysis
- Apply statistical tests and visualise trends
- Fine-tune DistilBERT models with configurable training options

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    cd PoliPulseCA
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
